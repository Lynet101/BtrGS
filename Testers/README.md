This is 100% testers. They're just meant to make development a bit easier by culminating some of the functions and pci calls i know i'll need during development, into a small "package" that i can install on most linux-distro with minimal tweaking.

The code is messy, and it's not following "the unix way" (you're eg. interacting directly with a daemon), but i really couldn't be bothered making a tester any nicer than this. It works, it get's the job done, and modifying it is as easy as commenting out a single line, that what makes it a great tester
