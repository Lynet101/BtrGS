May i just add, the code in here isn't finished at all...
I'm just writting down my thoughts as functions, but havent started creating any ui, nor doing any function calls.
So if you see a function, variable or class, that makes you go _"huh?", just know i probably have an intent for it further down the line.
Again, at this stage it's purely experimental, and i just want a place to post my findings, and release a 'product' the second i got things working
