Introduction:

The GPU Redirector Library is a tool for redirecting GPU rendering data from an application to a specified GPU driver. This library is meant as a proof of concept to showcase the feasibility of creating an interface between an application and multiple GPU drivers, enabling seamless switching between GPUs.

Features:

    Redirects GPU rendering data from an application to a specified GPU driver
    Enables seamless switching between GPUs

The library is meant to be used in conjunction with a simple openGL based program, like glxgears. Given it's a proof of concept, no advanced programs should be attempted to run on this, as it could permanently corrupt important data, or otherwise damage the functionality of the program, operating system, or even the hardware itself.
