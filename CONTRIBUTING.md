Contributions should happen in the 'indev' folder. In here parts or 'modules' of the project can be worked on, by anyone.
Files can also be cloned and copied for developmental purposes, so to not screw up the work, that has already been done.

If you're unexperienced in something, this shouldn't detout you, just proceed with caution, and create backups of whatever you're
working on (Actually everyone should do that)

The general rules of course also applies here, with extra imfasis on the harmfull code part. Any intentionally harmfull code will result in a ban PERIOD.
I'm not going to push a project, with a F****** trojan in the kernel.
