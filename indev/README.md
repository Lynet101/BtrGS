This is the directory where things are developed!

Everything in here are changing constantly, and scripts are most likely not ready for testing (Once they are, they'll be moved to Development-deployments)

If you want to contribute with code, that's fantastic! there's a few different ways to do it:

- You can create your own file, and just go wild with it!
- you can copy other files, and try to improve them
- Lastly if you have no idea where to get started, head over to the 'issue' page. Here you can come with valuable input, and may even find an issue, that you believe you have the solution for.

Yes this is my project, but that doesn't mean i want to do everything by myself. The more i can include the community, the better the final product will be!


All files created within this repo are subject to get cloned and copied indifinetly within this project, for developmental purposes, and a dev cannot secure theyre work from this in any way shape or form. While I also won't disallow this to happen outside of this repo, I'll strongly encourage people to keep all development inside the repo.
This is not to kill creativity, but to ease the process of developing an entirely new technique. Once the method has been created, I'd be more than happy to see people create their own projects from this, and see the features and improvements that can be made. But again, that only after the method has been developed. I don't see any point in creating forks, and spin-off projects this early in development, as it would only cause confision, and slow every one down

Tip: you might want to use some of the tools in 'testing-tools' for this
