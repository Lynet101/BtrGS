This is the kernel of linux... Please proceed with caution!

If you, like myself, don't have a lot of experience with kernel development, I'm gonna have to ask you, like myself, to go somewhere else ;(
Don't get me wrong, there's still a lot of use for you on this project, but the kernel is a tricky piece of code, and getting the rest of the software to work, is going to really heavily on a prober implementation of the kernel.

That's also way i reach out here; If anyone has experience with kernel-dev, please get in touch with me. I don't have enough experience in kernels, to have faith in any deployments i might make, so i need someone else here



Otherwise, to the kernel devs here, you already know what to do. Just make sure to follow the guidelines from the previous directory, to not interupt each others work ;)
