What approach would yield a toolkit allowing for controlling a GPU(s) assigned to a process such that they can be assigned, paused and/or removed from said processes in real-time by the user. The crash data is imperative to the experiment and emphasis should be put on gathering as much information as possible.

Aim: Real-time GPU user controlled method to assign, switch and/or remove a GPU for any given process.

Scope: NVIDIA RTX 3050 TI (Laptop), AMD CPU (Ryzen 9 5900HS) with integrated graphics, the scope of the experiment will be expanded on based on the results.

Rationale: The experiment is aimed to improve energy savings in data centres and creation of seamless hybrid graphics.

Outcome: A proof of concept which can be improved on for future uses.

Additional information: Tests are run on Atrix linux (openrc-init), drivers Latest nvidia and amdgpu drivers. If amendments are required, they will be implemented.
