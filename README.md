# BtrGS

**OBS: THIS PROJECT IS TEMPORARILY SUSPENDED**
>This is due to the fact that the nvidia drivers just aren't there yet. They're no where near stable enough for a project like this to be feasable, and therefore I'm going to focus primarily on fixing nvidia before continuing with this project.

>I could probably develop something exclusively for AMD and INTEL, but I'd rather develop for everyone at once... + I'm pretty sure more people would appreciate a stable nvidia driver, rather than this

BtrGS is an attempt to unite different graphics concepts, to make GPU's more efficient, to benefit both end-users, data centers, and the environment

The first part will be attempting to transfer a running process, from one gpu to another. This should be done in such a way, that it would work universally on all GPUs, and can therefore not relly on proprietary techniques.
