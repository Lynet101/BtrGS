- PCI-hotswap [Primarily MB-manufactored technology, but might become usefull)
- Per-process GPU control
- PCI drivers
- PCI mem-transfer
- Use CPU core as HS (HotSwap) daughterboard/controller
- Copy framebuffer to Sys-RAM upon requested hotswap
- ||the start will be 'requested hotswap', meaning you'll need to request to remove your pci-card (eg. gpu) before removal can happen
- ||'Real hotswap' may become possible at some point, with surden devices, but would most likely never become possible with eg. GPUs as you would need to transfer frame-buffers and other essential data, before removal
- ||and keeping an up-to-date update of this data, would simply not be practical speed-wize
